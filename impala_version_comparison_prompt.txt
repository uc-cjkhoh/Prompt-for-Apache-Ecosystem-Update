My current Impala version: 4.3.0
Official documentation URL: https://impala.apache.org/impala-docs.html
My Apache Ecosystem Use Case:
"""
1. Store Parquet in Apache Hadoop
2. Manage parquet with Hive and Spark
3. Extract Data From Hive and Impala
4. Create Tableau Dashboard with Impala Connection
"""

Task 1 — Version Discovery:
- Fetch the documentation URL above.
- List ALL versions found on the page.
- Keep ONLY versions strictly greater than the current version (4.3.0).

---

Task 2 — Issue Research (for each version identified in Task 1):
- Fetch the Change Log page for that version from the documentation URL.
- For every New Feature and Improvement entry in the change log, evaluate whether it relates to any of the following categories:
    • SQL Execution / SQL Query
    • SQL Join
    • SQL Aggregation
    • SQL DDL / DML
    • SQL Runtime
    • SQL Filtering
    • SQL Functionality
    • SQL Performance
- INCLUDE the item if it matches one or more categories above.
- EXCLUDE the item if it ONLY relates to:
    • Bug fixes
    • UI-only changes
    • Documentation-only changes
    • Test fixes
    • Build/toolchain/packaging changes
    • Logging/monitoring-only changes with no SQL impact

---

Task 3 — Per-Issue Detail (for each included item):
Fetch the individual JIRA issue page at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/<ISSUE-KEY>
and extract the following fields:

1. Impala Version     — the version where this change was introduced
2. Issue Key         — the JIRA key exactly as shown (e.g. IMPALA-3268)
3. Title             — the EXACT title string from the JIRA issue page (do not paraphrase)
4. Description       — write a structured Jira-style description using this exact format:

    **Current behavior:**
    Currently, [explain what happens today and why it is a problem, using numbered steps if applicable]:
    1. Step or symptom one.
    2. Step or symptom two.
    3. ...

    **Root cause (if stated in the issue):**
    [One sentence explaining the technical root cause, or omit this section if not stated.]

    **Proposed change:**
    - [Bullet 1: what specifically changes]
    - [Bullet 2: additional details]
    - [Bullet 3: ...]

    **Note:** [Any important caveats, version requirements, or flag dependencies. Omit if none.]

5. What It Improves  — one of: SQL Execution, SQL Join, SQL Aggregation, SQL DDL, SQL DML,
                        SQL Runtime, SQL Filtering, SQL Functionality, SQL Performance
                        (use comma-separated values if multiple apply)

6. SQL Example       — a realistic, runnable SQL snippet that:
    a. Directly demonstrates the feature or improvement (not generic boilerplate)
    b. Includes a BEFORE comment block showing the old workaround (if applicable)
    c. Includes an AFTER comment block showing the new syntax or behavior
    d. Uses realistic table/column names relevant to analytics workloads

7. Estimated Performance Improvement — format as:
    "<metric>: ~X–Y% improvement under <condition>"
    Examples:
      "Query latency: ~70–90% reduction for COUNT(*) on large Parquet tables (footer-only read)"
      "Planning time: ~50–80% reduction for queries with 10+ nested inline view layers"
      "Write throughput: ~20–40% faster DELETE/UPDATE on Iceberg V2 tables"
    If this is a correctness fix with no measurable performance impact, write:
      "Correctness fix — prevents wrong results in <scenario>"

Output Format:
- Produce a single .xlsx file with two sheets:

  Sheet 1: "Upgrade Analysis"
    Columns: [Impala Version | Issue Key | jira page link | Title | Description | What It Improves | SQL Example | Estimated Performance Improvement]
    - Color-code rows by version (different background per version)
    - Freeze header row
    - Wrap text in all cells
    
  Sheet 2: "Summary"
    - Current version, versions analyzed, total item count
    - Per-version row showing: version, item count, comma-separated focus areas
